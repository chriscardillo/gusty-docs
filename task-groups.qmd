title: Task Groups

In Airflow, a [TaskGroup](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#taskgroups) is a fairly arbitrary - but often useful - grouping of tasks. In gusty, you can organize your Task Definition Files into Airflow task groups by simply adding subfolders to your DAG folder, and putting your Task Definition Files in each subfolder. As you might have guessed, the task group id is the same as the subfolder name.

For example, maybe we want our `hello_dag` to have it tasks organized into separate task groups based on the language of the greeting. Here's what the updated structure of our `hello_dag` DAG might look like:

```sh
$AIRFLOW_HOME/dags/
│
├── hello_dag/
│   │
│   ├── english/
│   │   ├── hello.yml
│   │   ├── hey.sql
│   │   └── hi.py
│   │
│   ├── french/
│   │   ├── bonjour.py
│   │   ├── bonsoir.sql
│   │   └── salut.yml
│   │
│   ├── spanish/
│   │   ├── hola.py
│   │   ├── oye.sql
│   │   └── saludos.yml
│   │
│   └── METADATA.yml
│
└── hello_dag.py
```

Now, our Airflow DAG will have three task groups: `english`, `french`, and `spanish`. Each task group will contain the tasks found in each folder. For example, the `french` task group will contain tasks `bonjour`, `bonsoir`, and `salut`.

By default, gusty does *not* prefix a task group's name on to the task name. Any altering of a task name inside of a task group is done so explcitly. How? Just like DAG folders, task group folders can also leverage their own `METADATA.yml` files.

## Task Group METADATA.yml

You can add a `METADATA.yml` file to any task group folder. This is useful for when you want to have specific task group behavior, such as different `default_args` or if you want to prefix or suffix the task group id onto the task id.

Let's add a `METADATA.yml` file to our `spanish` task group subfolder:

```sh
dags/
│
├── hello_dag/
│   │
│   ├── english/
│   │   ├── hello.yml
│   │   ├── hey.sql
│   │   └── hi.py
│   │
│   ├── french/
│   │   ├── bonjour.py
│   │   ├── bonsoir.sql
│   │   └── salut.yml
│   │
│   ├── spanish/
│   │   ├── METADATA.yml
│   │   ├── hola.py
│   │   ├── oye.sql
│   │   └── saludos.yml
│   │
│   └── METADATA.yml
│
└── hello_dag.py
```

The contents of this task group `METADATA.yml` file might look something like this:

```yaml
tooltip: "This task group contains Spanish greetings."
prefix_group_id: True
```

The above `METADATA.yml` will give the `spanish` task group a tooltip, when hoving over the node in the Airflow UI's graph view, and all tasks in the task group will be prefixed with `spanish_`, such as `spanish_oye` and `spanish_saludos`.

Here is a look at the tooltip on hover:

And here is look at the prefixed Spanish tasks:

Lastly, just like tasks, task group `METADATA.yml` can take advantage of `dependencies` blocks. So if a lot of tasks depend on the same upstream task, it might make sense to put them in the same task group folder, and set the upstream dependency in the `METADATA.yml`.

## Why Use Task Group Folders?

Task groups folders serve a few powerful purposes at scale:

- They help keep Task Definition Files organized.

- They can help keep parts of a DAG logically compartmentalized.

- They can help keep dependencies between sets of tasks easier to manage.

## Ignoring Subfolders

Sometimes you want gusty to disregard subfolders when creating a DAG. For this, there are two options.

If you want to ignore all subfolders, you can add `ignore_subfolders=True` as an argument to `create_dag`.

If you only want to ignore some subfolders, you can add a file called `.gustyignore` to those the subfolders you would like ignored.
